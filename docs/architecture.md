# Architecture

`middag-io/ui` is the **contract-builder** layer of the MIDDAG stack: a transport- and host-agnostic
library for describing a UI as an immutable, serializable value object — the **page contract** — that
something downstream renders. It has zero runtime dependencies (PHP `^8.2` only).

## The PageContract system

A page is built up from value objects, never from markup. Builders compose a tree of concerns
(regions, forms, tables, blocks, navigation, actions) and the root **page contract** serializes to
JSON (`JsonSerializable`). A renderer — `middag-io/framework`'s Inertia renderer, a host adapter, or
the `@middag-io/react` client — turns that JSON into a UI.

The contract is the entire public surface: if a value can appear on the wire, it is a `readonly`
value object with a deterministic `jsonSerialize()`; if it is a boundary object a renderer maps
manually (e.g. `FieldDefinition`, `Condition`), it does **not** implement `JsonSerializable`, to avoid
coupling the model to a wire format.

## The OSS boundary — why nothing here renders

This package is the bottom of the stack and defines only generic contracts. **Rendering, host wiring,
and HTTP transport live downstream**, never here:

- **No contract produces HTML** (`render(): string`). ui contracts produce **data / value objects**
  (e.g. `FormRendererInterface` → `RendererOutput`, not a string). Rendering is a product/host concern.
- **No host knowledge.** No `mform`, `wpdb`, capability calls, column names, or plugin conventions.
- **Authorization is data, not a call.** Opaque authorization tokens (the `capability` field on
  `Action`/`NavigationNode`/`CrudBuilder`) are data the contract carries. Calling a host API to
  resolve them is forbidden here — the adapter does that downstream.

## Concern-first layout

`src/` is organised by **UI concern**, each a top-level directory:

| Concern | What it carries |
|---------|-----------------|
| `Action/` | the canonical `Action` value object + its discriminated `ActionTarget` (link / route / request) |
| `Block/` | content blocks (`BlockBuilder`, `BlockDescriptor`) and the `Section` layout primitive |
| `Condition/` | the `Condition` value object (field visibility/requirement rules) |
| `Envelope/` | the response envelope around a contract |
| `Form/` | the form model — `FieldDefinition`, `Group`, form state and renderer contracts |
| `Inspector/` | detail/inspector view contracts |
| `Navigation/` | navigation nodes and registries |
| `Page/` | the page contract entry points and page metadata |
| `Region/` | page regions and fragments (partial updates) |
| `Table/` | tables and the CRUD builder |
| `Shared/` | cross-cutting `Enum/` (closed catalogs), `Data/` (value objects), `Schema/` (JSON-schema emission) |

Inside each concern, `@api` interfaces live in a `Contract/` sub-namespace (suffix `Interface`),
fluent builders return `static` and produce value objects, and leaf value objects are `final
readonly`. A VO paired with a dedicated `*Interface` extension seam may be `readonly` (non-`final`).

> **The wire value objects are an intentionally interlinked cluster.** An envelope can embed any
> payload; an `ActionResult` carries either a full page contract or a partial fragment; a `CrudBuilder`
> emits a page contract. So "concern" here is an organisational axis, **not** an acyclic dependency
> boundary — the cross-references between concerns are inherent to the domain, not a layering defect.

## Three composition levels

The builders meet you at the level of control you need:

- **L1 — convention.** Name your columns/fields and accept the conventional shape (e.g. `CrudBuilder`
  derives sensible columns from names).
- **L2 — convention + overrides.** Start from the convention, then override individual pieces
  (a column's label, format, sortability) via a configurator.
- **L3 — free composition.** Build the value objects directly for full control.

## The wire contract and JSON schemas

The emitted JSON schemas under `schema/` (`page-contract.json`, `fragment.json`) are **published
artifacts**: the `@middag-io/react` client and other consumers codegen against them. `SchemaRegistry`
(in `Shared/Schema/`) is the single source of truth; `bin/emit-schemas.php` writes the files and
`composer check` runs it with `--check` to fail on drift. The schemas are strict — every object is
`additionalProperties:false` and discriminated unions (like `ActionTarget`) use `oneOf` on a `kind`
const — so the contract stays a small, stable, machine-checkable wire format.
